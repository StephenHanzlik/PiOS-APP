Project Requirements
The goal of this project is to put what you've learned to use and also to stretch you a little:

Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor
Follow an agile development workflow
Create and deploy a complete CRUD app
Present your work to the class

Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

For this project, you will be assigned into groups of four or five. Together, you will need to come up with a product idea, and write it as a proposal that includes:

A project description
Who uses it?
What outputs do they need?
What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
A list of technologies that you plan to use
An MVP with listed user stories
A list of "Nice to have" features
There are some constraints around what technologies MUST be present in your app. Check out Create and deploy a web app below.


Create and deploy a complete CRUD app

Your web app should:

CRUD
Allow users to create, read, update, and delete data from a form
HTML

Make good use of semantic HTML tags
Be well-indented, validated, etc.
CSS

Be well-designed
You can use a styling framework like Bootstrap
If you are using Bootstrap, please consider theming with something like bootswatch, customizing the download with SASS, or a customizer
Be well-indented and clean
Use at least one web font
Split code into separate files where appropriate
Responsive design optional but strongly encouraged
JavaScript
Well-indented, linted, and use excellent variable names
Split code into separate files where appropriate
Optionally, use a test-driven development approach
Workflow
Use wireframes to create your layouts before you build them
Use a feature-branch workflow for your user stories
Your APP should:

SCHEMA

Have a well designed schema
Use Migrations locally as well as on Heroku
Separate entities accordingly and use foreign and primary keys
CRUD

Have create, read, update, and delete operations on multiple routes
Be designed according to RESTful principles
CRUD data from/to a relational database using SQL or an ORM like Knex
API

Must have at least 1 API integration (Not counting OAuth)
Auth

Support functionality for three role types:
A non-logged in user
A logged-in user with limited permissions
A logged-in superuser
Support login via a social network
Passwords should be hashed (stretch, see BCrypt in Help Desk)
Use signed Cookies
Database
Use Postgres
Workflow
Use a feature-branch workflow for your user stories
Document dependencies in a package.json file

Make a video highlighting the functionality of your app

Make a 3-6 minute video explaining your project and demonstrating its features

Complete a write-up of the project

Describe what the project is, the technologies you used, and some information about the workflow you followed.
1-2 tight paragraphs

Add all three of these to an online portfolio

Create a portfolio on the student portal
Link to your final deployed site, your video, your respositories, and your write-up
This will be added to your web development portfolio

Present your work to the class

Be prepared to spend ~10 minutes presenting your work to the class.
This is a realistic approximation of what developing real products on a software team is like. You will have approximately 20-25 hours of class time to work on this. It will not be enough time to do a good job on this project. Plan on spending extra time outside of class, and coordinate this time with your team. This is another Big Deal Week, and you should put maximum effort into making it successful. You can and should use your teammates, classmates on other teams, and your instructors as learning resources, but this should be your own work.
